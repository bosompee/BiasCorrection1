## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

FORECASTING of the bias corrected NHM streamflow data
```{r}
FC <- read.csv("C:/Users/p739b253/OneDrive - University of Kansas/FEWtures/Bias correction_NHM/FC.csv")
FC

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#checking if the dataset is a time series
class(FC)  #data is in "dataframe" form

#converting the data first to time series
FCtime=ts(FC[,2],start=c(1980,10),frequency = 12)

#checking again if the dataset is a time series
class(FCtime)  #data is in "ts" now

library(forecast)
library(tseries)
plot(FCtime)

acf(FCtime)
pacf(FCtime)

adf.test(FCtime)

FCModel= auto.arima(FCtime,ic="aic",trace = TRUE)
FCModel
acf(ts(FCModel$residuals))
pacf(ts(FCModel$residuals))
```

FORECAST

```{r}
FCModel_forecast <- forecast(FCModel, level = c(95), h = 10*12)
FCModel_forecast

plot(FCModel_forecast)

```

```{r}
# Validation of forecast using the "box test" function

Box.test(FCModel_forecast$resid, lag = 5, type = "Ljung-Box")

Box.test(FCModel_forecast$resid, lag = 10, type = "Ljung-Box")
```
The p-value is greater than 0.05 which means the forecasted data is not having auto correlation
