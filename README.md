The USGS NHM-PRMS streamflow results (Hay, 2019) were downloaded from the USGS ScienceBase (Application of the National Hydrologic Model Infrastructure with the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (NHM-PRMS), by HRU Calibrated Version - ScienceBase-Catalog). The USGS measured streamflow results were obtained from the National Water Information System (NWIS) (USGS, 2022) (Water Resources of the United Statesâ€”National Water Information System (NWIS) Mapper (usgs.gov), for example: (USGS 07130500 ARKANSAS RIVER BELOW JOHN MARTIN RESERVOIR, CO.) 
The code used to process NHM data to do the analyses and visualizations in the manuscript is available on GitHub: https://github.com/bosompee/github_P/tree/main/BiasCorrection
